This bot will: 

*  auto jump at a random point on the plane between 40-70 seconds after the plane appears. 

* auto hold down the space bar just in case you land in water and end up underwater 

* It will also lay down after running and jumping. 

* I added a few more configs to the bot so it supports 2560x 1440p and 2560 x1080p. I dont have the last resolution so it might not work well for 2560 x 1080p.

In that case you will need to run your monitor at one of the other three supported resolutions. 

Turn off any color corrections like reshade before using the bot otherwise it will not work. 



Directions: 

Make sure the game isnt open.

1.Open the bot (it takes a few seconds to load)
2. Choose your resolution 
3. hit start
4. The bot will open the game. Wait for the game to load and the bot wiill auto start working. (Dont worry if the bot ui freezes up, thats normal. )

MAKE SURE YOU ARE RUNNING FULLSCREEN WINDOWED WITH RESHADE TURNED OFF

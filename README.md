# AfK-Farm-Bot
Bot for Playerunknown Battlegrounds (PUBG) that AFK farms battlepoints(bp)

The bot is run via an gui and not the command line(cmd) so its easier for the average person to use and understand.

# Working status

Works even after the update in September that disabled most bots.


# Releases, and getting support
Support and new releases/updates will be handled through AFk-Bot Discord located here:

You can just join and get the download and leave if you want! Stick around if you want updates and help.

If you rather not here is the download link:
[Direct download](https://sabercathost.com/9h35/PUBG_Farmer_1.30.zip)
 

It is easier and faster for me to respond via discord and keep everyone updated.

# Donate

If I get some donations to support the huge time investment it would take, I will definitely work on the features above. Either way the bot remains free.

You do not need an paypal account to use this:

# Directions for GUI Bot

* Just click the exe and wait a few seconds for it to load 

* Pick your screen resolution and hit start!

* Close the game before you start if its already open.


# Future

I plan to keep updating the bot with new functions like:

* Auto fighting afk players so you can leave earlier(I have an idea of how to do it but it will be more long term) 

* Selecting the server

* Selecting the random jump time 

* Getting the quit button to work again(lol I swear it used to work)

If you see someone repacking it elsewhere it probably isnt safe..


# Errors

if the bot is not doing anything try:

* Making sure reshade or any other color changers is turned off

* Making sure your screen and game resolution matches the resolution you selected

* Making sure you are running the game in fullscreen windowed

* if its crashing, make sure to close the game before starting the bot, the bot will open the game for you!

if you need more assistance ping me in the discord [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/5CEJVJk)

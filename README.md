# PUBG-Afk-FarmBot
A working AFk battlepoint(bp) farming bot for playerunknown battle grounds. 

## Check the Releases tab for the precompiled ready to go exe. No coding necessary.   
Here https://github.com/Clintoxen/PUBG-Afk-FarmBot/releases

This is fully working even after the september patch that stopped most bots

The new bot is run via an gui and not the command line(cmd) so its easier for the average person to use and understand.

## Bot Source Code
The source code in this repo is the current code in the GUI bot exe. 

The source code does not contain the gui.

I still need to update the code with a few bug fixes and documenting the functions but I wanted to get this out now before I get busy again.

You can see how the auto jump/rum/plane jump/laydown functions work in this bot from the bottom of the source code. I rewrote this with my friend @abneyma(who is also on github) and one other person.

# Directions for using source code

In order to run this you need to make a gui or call the run function or the bot class at the end of the code. Also will need to edit the setConfig function.

After that open cmd in the folder with the python script(afkbot1.py) make sure the config file is in that folder as well. type "python afkbot1.py" into cmd and it will run.

Your screen and game resolution has to be 1080p if you use the default config and make sure reshade is off.

# Directions for GUI Bot
Just click the exe and wait a few seconds for it to load, pick your screen resolution and hit start!

# Future

I plan to keep updating the bot with new functions: 

* auto fighting afk players so you can leave earlier. (I have an idea of how to do it but it will be more long term) if I get some donations to support the huge time investment it would take. Either way the bot remains free.)

* Selecting  the server from the GUI

* selecting the random jump time range

If you see someone repacking it elsewhere it probably isnt safe..

# Errors
if you have an error saying an msvcp120.dll  is missing download https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/download/confirmation.aspx?id=30679 or https://fix4dll.com/msvcp120_dll

* If the bot opens and it doesnt click anything make sure your monitor and game is the correct resolution, 

* That the game is running in fullscreen windowed mode 

* You are using the correct config

# Pull requests
Are welcome, if you have something interesting to add then go ahead and ill test it and add it to the source code.

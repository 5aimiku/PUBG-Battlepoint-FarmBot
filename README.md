# Directions for Farmer Bot

* Just click the exe and wait a few seconds for it to load 

* Pick your screen resolution and hit start!

* Close the game before you start if its already open.

* Make sure PUBG is in full screen windowed


# Errors

if the bot is not doing anything try:

* Making sure reshade or any other color changers is turned off

* Making sure your screen and game resolution matches the resolution you selected

* Making sure you are running the game in fullscreen windowed

* if its crashing, make sure to close the game before starting the bot, the bot will open the game for you!

* TURN OFF WALLPAPER ENGINE:
it conflicts with this bot and will cause it to not work correctly

### Make sure you dont have any programs running in the background that take the focus of windows away from PUBG. Otherwise the bot will launch the game and not do anything. If you have this issue try alt + tabbing to see if the bot works correctly once pubg is the main window again

# Future plans

I plan to keep updating the bot with new functions like:

* Auto fighting afk players so you can leave earlier(I have an idea of how to do it but it will be more long term) 

* Selecting the server

* Selecting the random jump time 

* Getting the quit button to work again(lol I swear it used to work)

If you see someone repacking it elsewhere it probably isnt safe..

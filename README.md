# PUBG-Afk-FarmBot
A working AFk battlepoint(bp) farming bot for playerunknown battle grounds. Check the releases tab for the precompiled exe

The bot is run via an gui and not the command line(cmd) so its easier for the average person to use and understand.

The source code in this repo is older code from a month ago before I rewrote it and added the gui (python +gui isnt fun lol). 

I plan on updating this repo with the new code for the bot only(not the gui) in the near future after a few bug fixes and documenting it.

You can see how the auto jump/rum/plane jump/laydown functions work in this bot from the bottom of this old source code. I didnt really change anything in that reguard when I rewrote this with my friend @mabney11.

# Directions
They are explained in a readme file in the release zip

I plan to keep updating the bot with new functions (like auto fighting afk players so you can leave earlier. I have an idea of how to do it but it will be more long term) if I get some donations to support the huge time investment it would take. Either way the bot remains free. If you see someone repacking it elsewhere it probably isnt safe..

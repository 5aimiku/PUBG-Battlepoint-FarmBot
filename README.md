# PUBG-Afk-FarmBot

## Check the Releases tab for the precompiled ready to go exe. No coding necessary.   

[Releases](https://github.com/Clintoxen/PUBG-Afk-FarmBot/releases "GUIBot")

ver. 1.06 is working. 

Works even after the september patch that stopped most bots.

The new bot is run via an gui and not the command line(cmd) so its easier for the average person to use and understand.

## Bot Source Code
The source code is the current code(not including the tkinter gui code) in the GUI bot exe. 

I still need to document the code, but I wanted to get this out now before I get busy again.

I rewrote this with one other person.

# Directions for using source code

In order to run this you need to make a gui, or call the "bot" class at the end of the code. 

You also will need to edit the setConfig function. I already have some working code for that commented out.

Your screen and game resolution has to be 1080p if you use the default config.

# Directions for GUI Bot
* Make sure the game isnt open/running
* Just click the exe and wait a few seconds for it to load, pick your screen resolution and then hit start!

# Future

I plan to keep updating the bot with new functions: 

* Auto fighting afk players so you can leave earlier. I have an idea of how to do it but it will be more long term (Only if I get some donations to support the huge time investment it would take. Either way the bot remains free.)

* Selecting  the server from the GUI

* Selecting the random jump time range

If you see someone repacking it elsewhere it probably isnt safe..

# Donate
Donate via bitcoin or payal if you want to support continued development or not, thanks.

# Errors

* If the bot opens and it doesnt click anything make sure your monitor and game is set to the correct resolution. 

* Make sure the game is running in fullscreen windowed mode. 

* MAke sure you are using the correct config(source code).

* Make sure Reshade isnt changing your games colors.

* MAke sure you are not starting the bot when the game is open(works for some, causes issues for others)

# Pull requests
Are welcome, if you have something interesting to add then go ahead and ill test it and add it to the source code/bot.

# Donate

If I get some donations to support the huge time investment it would take(time = money), I will definitely work on the future features below. Either way the bot remains free.  

You do not need an paypal account to donate:

# Directions for GUI Bot

* Just click the exe and wait a few seconds for it to load 

* Pick your screen resolution and hit start!

* Close the game before you start if its already open.


# Future plans

I plan to keep updating the bot with new functions like:

* Auto fighting afk players so you can leave earlier(I have an idea of how to do it but it will be more long term) 

* Selecting the server

* Selecting the random jump time 

* Getting the quit button to work again(lol I swear it used to work)

If you see someone repacking it elsewhere it probably isnt safe..


# Errors

if the bot is not doing anything try:

* Making sure reshade or any other color changers is turned off

* Making sure your screen and game resolution matches the resolution you selected

* Making sure you are running the game in fullscreen windowed

* if its crashing, make sure to close the game before starting the bot, the bot will open the game for you!

if you need more assistance ping me in the discord [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/5CEJVJk)
